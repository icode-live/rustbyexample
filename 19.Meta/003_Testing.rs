Functions can be tested by using these [attributes](http://rustbyexample.com/attribute.html):

    #[test] marks a function as a unit test. The function must take zero parameters and return nothing.
    #[should_panic] marks a function as a panicking test.

Tests can be run with cargo test or rustc --test.

$ rustc --test unit_test.rs
$ ./unit_test

running 2 tests
test test::distance_test ... ok
test test::failing_test ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

If --test were not included, then this would happen

$ rustc unit_test.rs
$ ./unit_test
If you see this, the tests were not compiled nor ran!
